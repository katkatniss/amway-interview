# üéØ Amyway Interview

This project consists of a microservices-based architecture that includes four main services:

- Cloud Gateway - API gateway for routing requests.

- Service Registry - Eureka server for service discovery.

- Calculator Service - A RESTful API that performs mathematical calculations.

- Prize Wheel Service - An API for an e-commerce spin-the-wheel lottery system.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ensure you have the following installed:

Java 17+

Maven 3+

Docker (optional for containerization)

# Installation & Running the Services

**Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/katkatniss/amway-interview.git
cd amway-interview
```

**Run services with Docker:**

- Generate the jar file for running:
```sh
mvn clean install -Dskiptests=true
```
- Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for services
```sh
docker-compose -f compose.yml up --build --force-recreate
```

**Run services with spring boot embedded server:**

Start the Service Registry (Eureka):
```sh
cd service-registry
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Start Cloud Gateway:
```sh
cd cloud-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Start Calculator Service:
```sh
cd calculator-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Start Prize Wheel Service:
```sh
cd prize-wheel-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```
